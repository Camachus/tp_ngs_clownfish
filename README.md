# TP NGS Clowwnfish

_**Redmed Miguel Camacho**_

_Actinoterygian_ fishes present different patterns of pigmentation. These patterns of adult pigmentation are important for ecology, development and genetics. 

_Actinoterygian_ fishes present 8 cell types of pigmentation compared  to mammals, that have only one. Two of these pigmentation cells are iridophore that refers to a reflective tissue and leucophore for white tissue.

Here, authors asked whether the white bars of the coral reef fish _**Amphiprion ocellaris**_, known as the clown fish, are composed of iridophores or with leucophores or maybe both. To answer this question, we used the transcriptomic analysis  through this TP NGS.

## Project                                          16/11/200
Analysis of the _A. ocellaris_ fish skin transcriptome to find gene candidates involved in the presence of iridophores in white skin.

## Dataset 
Samples were taken from 3 individuals: each one with orange and white tissue (in total 6 samples).
The RNA-Senquencing method was carried out with the Illumina technology Signle-End (50 reads)

## Objective
 To determine the presence of the gen saiyan, a candidate gene involved in the presence of iridophores in white strips.
